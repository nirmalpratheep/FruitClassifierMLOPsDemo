# End-to-End MLOps Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates a full MLOps pipeline, covering the following key steps:

- **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Gathering and preparing data for model training.
- **Model Training**: Training machine learning models using best practices.
- **Model Validation and Hyperparameter Tuning**: Evaluating the model and fine-tuning hyperparameters.
- **Model Deployment**: Deploying the model in a production environment.
- **Model Monitoring**: Continuously monitoring the model performance and health in production.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automating the workflow for model training, testing, and deployment.
  
This is a comprehensive MLOps setup with a focus on automation, version control, and scalability, integrating tools such as:

- **MLflow**: For model tracking and management.
- **Kubernetes**: For model deployment and scaling.
- **Docker**: For containerizing the application.
- **Jenkins**: For CI/CD pipeline automation.
- **TensorBoard**: For tracking model training and performance.
- **Prometheus/Grafana**: For monitoring model performance.
